# Pablo Su√°rez - Slang Coding Challenge
Hi! Thank you for checking out my submission to this challenge.
You can find the file with my answer on the path "n-grams Coding Challenge\src\NGrams.java"
Alternatively, you can open a command line instance and navigate to the "build" directory where you'll find the executable jar "NGrams.jar". There, input the command "java -jar NGrams.jar" and that way you'll be able to interact directly with my solution.
